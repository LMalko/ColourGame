                <h3 class="title">New York</h3>
                <p>During the years of 1898â€“1945, New York City
                    consolidated and came to dominate American life.
                    New York City became the capital of national
                    communications, trade, and finance, and of
                    popular culture and high culture.</p>

                        <h4>Machine politics versus the reformers</h4>
                        <p>The politics of the consolidated city revolved around conflicts between the political machines and the reformers. In the quiet times, the machines had a solid core of supporters and usually exercised control of city and borough affairs; they also played a major role in the state legislature in Albany. Tammany Hall from the 1880s and onward built a strong network of local clubs that attracted ambitious middle-class ethnics. In times of crisis however, especially in the severe depressions of the 1890s and the 1930s, the reformers took control of key offices, notably the mayor's office. </p>

                        <h4>Education</h4>
                        <p>Progressive Era reformers strongly promoted free public schooling through high school, on the assumption that ignorance was a waste and that learning developed the personality as well as skills needed in a modernizing society. Public school enrollment rose from 553,000 in 1900, to 1.1 million in 1930, and then declined a bit. </p>

                        <h4>Journalism</h4>
                        <p>By the turn of the 20th century, the city had 15 to 20 daily newspapers, and many weeklies. Most newspapers were sold at newsstands or hawked by newsboys, as opposed to subscriptions. The Wall Street Journal provided detailed coverage of business affairs. The New York Times had shrunk to almost nothing by the 1890s.</p>

                        <h4>Disasters</h4>
                        <p>On June 15, 1904, over 1,000 people, mostly German ethnics, were killed when the excursion steamship General Slocum caught fire and burned in the East River. It was a major blow to the German-American community.</p>

                <p>In 1664, the city was named after the Duke of York, who would become King James II. James's older brother, King Charles II of England, had appointed the Duke proprietor of the former territory of New Netherlands, including the city of New Amsterdam, which England had recently seized from the Dutch.</p>
