# 1. Colour Game

The goal is to guess the colour that matches RGB selection on the top.

>An RGB color value is specified with: rgb(red, green, blue).
>Each parameter (red, green, and blue) defines the intensity of the color as an integer between 0 and 255.
>For example, rgb(0, 0, 255) is rendered as blue, because the blue parameter is set to its highest value (255) and the others are set to 0.   (from: https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_rgb.asp)
